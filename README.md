# SlytherinGame

The Snake Game using Javascript, CSS and HTML (with french comments).


# How does it work ?

- The user leads the snake to the apple using the four arrows of the keyboard.
  
- If the apple is eaten :
  - It gets a random position on the canvas (just not on the snake) and can be eaten again.
  - The snake grows gaining one more block.
  - One point is added to the score.
  
- If the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body : the game is over.
  
- If the game is over :
  - The user can press the spacebar to play again.
  - The snake and the apple appear again on the positions they had at the start of the game.
  - The snake gets back to its original length.
  - The score restarts from zero.
