# SlytherinGame

The Snake Game using Javascript, CSS and HTML (with french comments).

# How does it work ?

- The user leads the snake to the apple using the four arrows of the keyboard.
- If the apple is eaten : it gets another position on the canvas and can be eaten again, the snake grows gaining one more block, and one point is added to the score.
- If the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body : the game is over.
- If the game is over : the user can press the spacebar to play again.
