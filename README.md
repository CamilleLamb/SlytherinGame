# SlytherinGame

The Snake Game using Javascript, CSS and HTML (with french comments).


# How does it work ?

- The user leads the snake to the apple using the four arrows of the keyboard.
  
- If the apple is eaten :
  it gets a random position on the canvas (just not on the snake) and can be eaten again,
  the snake grows gaining one more block,
  and one point is added to the score.
  
- If the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body : the game is over.
  
- If the game is over :
  the user can press the spacebar to play again,
  the snake and the apple appear again on the positions they had at the start of the game,
  the snake gets back to its original length,
  and the score restarts from zero.
